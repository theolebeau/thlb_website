In this project, gathering multiple works, I use a simulated replica of the Virgo cluster to study the gas physics in and around this complex galaxy cluster. This case study serves as a great pathfinder in the scope of the larger LOCALIZATION project. The constrained hydrodynamical simulation was made by Jenny Sorce using the AMR code RAMSES, allowing us to resolve fluid dynamics in cells down to 0.3kpc scales in the densest regions. Simulating a real cluster permits direct one-to-one comparison with observations, thus helping to strengthen the complementarity between numerical simulations and observations. So far, I'v been studying projection effects on the estimation the hydrostatic mass and its bias, I estimated the splashback radius in different regions of Virgo and I'm currently interested in the study of turbulence in Virgo's core and in its connected filaments.
