#abstract: 'Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures of the Universe.
Those objects lie at the nodes of the cosmic web, these are peaks in the matter distribution in
the Universe. Galaxy clusters are thus cosmological probes that help us to constrain parameters
of the standard model of cosmology provided that their masses are known. Cluster masses can
be estimated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, but several physical and observational effects
can alter this calculation. The aim of my PhD is to quantify the impact of those sources of
bias on the so-called hydrostatic mass bias. Iâ€™m using a large scale cosmological simulation
that reproduces the Local Universe. It permits me to compare the simulated galaxy clusters
to the real observed ones. With this simulation, I will be able to faithfully quantify the biases
due to the peculiar cluster population surrounding us compared to a random cluster population
extracted from standard cosmological simulations. During this talk, I will first present the scope
of my work. Then I will briefly show the results of a first case study on the Virgo cluster of
galaxies on which I studied the projection effects.'
