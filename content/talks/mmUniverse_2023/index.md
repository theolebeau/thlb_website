summary: 'An accurate mass calibration of galaxy clusters is a crucial step towards precise constraints
on the cosmological parameters σ8 and Ωm from clusters. In the millimeter, via the Sunyaev-
Zel’dovich (SZ) effect, and X-rays domains, cluster masses can be estimated assuming hydro-
static equilibrium, but several physical and observational effects can alter this calculation. One
of those are projection effects which are the focus of our present analysis.
As a matter of fact, any hot and ionised gas along the line of sight of clusters can contribute
to the observed pressure and thus impact our analysis of the clusters’ SZ or X-ray signals.
Moreover, the usually assumed spherical symmetry of clusters is not always verified, so the
observed properties may strongly depend on the direction of observation. Cosmological simu-
lations permit us to study the clusters from any point of view, they are therefore well suited to
study projection effects.
In this presentation, I will show the results of a case study of the simulated Virgo cluster,
extracted from the CLONE constrained simulation. In this study, we analyse Virgo properties
when they are projected along different directions, including along the Milky Way-Virgo axis
which mimics our observation direction. By comparing the deduced hydrostatic mass and the
hydrostatic mass bias from the different observation directions to the one derived from the 3D
profiles, we will show and quantify the impact of projection effects on the determination of
Virgo mass as a first analysis that will later be generalised to a large sample of simulated clone
clusters.'
