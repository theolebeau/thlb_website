abstract: 'This is the second paper in a series presenting the results from a 500 h−1Mpc large constrained simulation of the local
Universe (SLOW). The initial conditions for this cosmological hydro-dynamical simulation are based on peculiar velocities derived
from the CosmicFlows-2 catalog. The simulation follows cooling, star formation, and the evolution of super-massive black holes.
This allows one to directly predict observable properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) within galaxy clusters, including X-ray
luminosity, temperatures, and the Compton-y signal.'
